#### Rating: 4 / 5

This is the first book I read on how to make better decisions. I have never really thought about having a process around making important decisions. I realize I mostly end up trusting my gut when I make decisions. I am going to try and incorporate some of the practices mentioned in the book when I try to make decisions. This book has a lot of useful practical advice. The notes below try to incoorporate some of that advice.

### Chapter Notes

#### Chapter 1: Intro

- Good decision making process lot more important than trusting your gut or conducting rigorous analysis.
- Villian 1: Narrow Framing (liming the options we have)
- Villain 2: Confirmation bias
- Villain 3: Short Term Emption
  - Andy Grove got distance -> What would our successors do?
- Villain 4: Overconfidence
- Better decisions: Use WRAP
  - Widen your options
  - Reality Test your assumptions
  - Attain distance
  - Prepare to be wrong

#### Chapter 2: Avoid a narrow frame

- We tend to get trapped in a narrow frame (e.g. should I do this or not?)
- Often we have a lot more options than we think
- To escape narrow framing, think about opportunity cost
  - e.g. Keep money for other purchases
- Try Vanishing options -> What if the current options disappeared?
- "Whether or not" decisions should set off warning bells

#### Chapter 3: Multitrack

- Consider more than option simultaneously.
- Push for one or two more options - payoff can be huge
- When designers created multiple ads simultaneously, scored higher on creativity.
- Push for "this AND that" rather than "this OR that"

#### Chapter 4: Find someone who has solved your problem

- Look outside: competitive analysis, benchmarking, best practices
- encode your greatest hits in a decision "playlist"

#### Chapter 5: Consider the opposite

- Confirmation bias = hunting for information that confirms our initial assumptions
- Spark constructive disagreement within our organizations
- Force ourselves to consider the opposite of our instincts
- Requires discipline to seek the opposite

#### Chapter 6: Zoom Out, Zoom In

- We should trust "the averages" over our instinct a lot more than we do.
- Inside view = our evaluation of the specific situation / outside view = how things generally unfold in situations like ours. Outside view is generally more accurate.
- Ask experts for "base rates" for your decision.

#### Chapter 7: Ooch

- Ooching: running small experiments to test our theories.
- Useful when we are terrible at predicting the future.

#### Chapter 8: Overcome Short-Term emotion

- Fleeting emotions can tempt us to make decisions that are bad in the long term.
- Attain some distance before making decisions.
- 10/10/10 -> forces us to consider long term / future emotions as well as present ones.
- Our decisions often altered by two subtle short-term emotions -> more exposure, we like what's familiar to us, loss aversion
- Look at your situation from an observer's perspective: What would my best friend tell me in this case?

#### Chapter 9: Honor your Core Priorities

- Agonizing decisions are often a sign of conflict among your core priorities
  - Core priorities: long-term emotional values, goals, aspirartions, what kind of person you want to be?
- When you identify and enshrine core priorities -> makes it easier to resolve present and future dilemmas

#### Chapter 10: Bookend the future

- Future is not a "point" - a single scenario we must predict -> it is a range. We should bookend the future considering a range of outcomes (from very bad to very good)
- Prepare for the lower bookend: we need a premortem. It's a year from now -> Our decision has failed. Why?
- Similarly, upper bookend: preparade.
- Use a safety factor

#### Chapter 11: Set a tripwire

- Tripwire can snap us awake and make us realize we have a choice. e.g. Zappos offering $1,000 to new hires.
- Tripwires are useful when change is gradual.

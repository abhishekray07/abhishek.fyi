I have generally been an optimistic person for my whole life. However, I never really thought of optimism as a skill which could be learned. I just figured that was a trait I was born with.

However, over the last year or so, I have come to believe that optimism is a skill that can be learned and trained. According to recent research, people aren't born optimistic or pessimistic. Our attitude and mindset play a huge role in our outlook on life. Research has shown that optimistic people tend to stay motivated for longer and are generally healthier.

Some of the practices which have helped me be more optimistic in life are:

- Maintaining a gratitude journal.
- Notice what's going well instead of only focusing on the negative.
- Meditation and staying calm

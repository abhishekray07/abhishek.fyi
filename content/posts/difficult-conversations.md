#### Rating: 5 / 5

I really enjoyed reading this book and learning about how to have difficult conversations. This book was kind of eye-opening for me because I realized that usually when I have been in difficult conversations I have either said or reacted in a way which actually makes things worse. The book is practical and has a lot of examples which show how to apply the strategies during conversations.

### Chapter Notes

#### Chapter 4: Abandon the blame

- Blaming someone in a conversation is a bad idea
- Move towards contribution -> how everybody is contributing to a situation (doesn’t have to be 50-50)
- Easier to bring up contribution -> blame makes people defensive
- Find your own contribution - even if you aren’t to blame
- Don’t avoid hard conversations
- Develop empathy -> try to understand from the others perspective
- Contribution -> starting and saying is risky -> help them in the conversation

#### Chapter 5: Feelings

- Feelings are part of the conversation, having feelings is natural
- Become familiar with your feelings
- Find the feelings instead of judgement
- Express full spectrum of your feelings
- Acknowledge the other persons feelings

#### Chapter 6: Identity

- Identity -> when we get feedback which goes against our identity
- Accept -> that you will make mistakes and take responsibility
- Don’t try to control others’ reaction
- Prepare for how they might respond

#### Chapter 7: When to raise / when to let go

- How to know when to have a difficult conversation
- Figure out if you even need to raise the issue?
- Sometimes the right approach might be letting go
- Things might not always get better -> responsibility to do your best
- If you raise it -> mutual understanding should be the goal

#### Chapter 8 - begin from the third story

- Don’t start the conversation with your story
- Think like a third party -> mediator -> neutral story -> less likely to get reactions
- Invite the other person in the story

#### Chapter 9

- Listening well
- Be curious - help them make you understand
- Inquire to learn -> no statements as questions, paraphrase , acknowledge before problem solving
- Don’t use subtext - express yourself
- Share where your conclusions are coming from - your opinion - not “the truth”

I have spent quite a bit of time thinking about Process and Outcomes. A definition of *Process* by Merriam-Webster is, "a series of actions or operations conducing to an end" whereas a definition of *Outcome* is "something that follows as a result or consequence".

I personally like to think of Process as something that might eventually lead to a particular outcome. I say *might* because most of the time the outcome is outside our control whereas the process is something we can personally control.

For example:

- If the eventual goal or outcome is to win a gold medal at the Olympics, that outcome is out of your control. There are so many events that could happen which might cause one to not win a gold medal. However, if the process is that one needs to train like a gold medalist over the course of the next few years, it is very much in your control.

This is the reason why I am more conscious and aware of the process and try not to worry about the outcomes. I try to focus on the things I can control and do well at those. I try to enjoy the process instead of being overly fixated on the outcome.

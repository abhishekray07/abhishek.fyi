I recently listened to [The War of Art by Steven Pressfield](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1319.The_War_of_Art).

One of the main themes of the book is Resistance. He refers to it as a force working against you. It tries to stop you from doing what you most need to do.

He gives some good suggestions about how to overcome resistance such as thinking of yourself as a pro and acting how a pro would act in that situation. He also talks about putting in the work every day and overcoming resistance.

The book got me thinking about how Resistance affects me on a daily basis.

- Procrastinating and watching videos on YouTube when I should be working on a project.
- Sleeping in longer when I should go to the gym.

A couple of days ago, I felt the force of resistance when I woke up in the morning and was about to go to the gym. I started rationalizing to myself that I can skip a day since I had been pretty regular and one day won't make a difference. I somehow overcame the resistance and ended up going to the gym.

It actually felt great to overcome resistance. I am going to try and be more aware of these invisible forces a lot more in my daily life.
